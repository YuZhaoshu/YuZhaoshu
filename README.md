Hi!👋 My name is Zhaoshu Yu (余兆舒 in Chinese). I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Applied Physics at Tongji University. In the latter half of this year, I shall commence doctoral studies at Tongji University’s School of Computer Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Jingkuan Song.

My research interests focus on Vision-Language-Action Models, Embodied AI and Multimodal Learning.
